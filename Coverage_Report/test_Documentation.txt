For you test cases we have great coverage for our program,
 but we have ran into the issue of the test coverage
 trying to cover every single file within each framework which
 is almost practically impossible to try and get complete coverage for them.
 As you can see we ran the coverage command for each test file and got
 a decent amount of coverage for the files we created.
 Sonarcloud unfortunately does not pick up the test
 cases from the py documents and hours have been put
 into having to try and figure it out, but there is coverage judging by the screen shots
 Also the bugs are primiarily from the frameworks and not from the code we have created 
 If there is any questions regarding test please email christianmarquardt14@hotmail.com
