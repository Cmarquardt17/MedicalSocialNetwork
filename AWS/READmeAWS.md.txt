Hello there, this is christian marquardt and I have created this readme file to explain that I have created an AWS
webapp for our MedicalSocialNetworkApp. I thas been preconfigured in Java since everyone in the group is pretty savvy 
java. This is only the beginning and the URL: http://medicalsocialnetworkappgrp11-env.mpmb38zk4u.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/
This is accessible anywhere and once we have our zero release and have some content we can push it and release it to our
online web hosted app. Our next focus will probably be the database side of things. 
This will also be discussed in our next meeting 1/27/2019. Cheers!
